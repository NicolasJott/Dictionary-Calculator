# Dictionary Calculator
This program functions as a calculator that takes input as full mathematical expressions using the 4 basic arithmetic operators (+-*/).
## Please Note
This program is able to process a sequence of valid arithmetic expressions that include the following:
<ul>
  <li>All numbers are non-negative integers</li>
  <li>The four basic arithmetic operations</li>
  <li>Parenthesis</li>
  <li>Variable names, up to 100 variables; follow the c++ naming rules</li>
  <li>Assignment in the form var = expression; note that the assignment is also an operator; its "result" is the expression on the right side of the =.</li>
</ul>
For each expression, the calculator evaluates it, displays the result and store the result in the appropriate variable, if necessary.
